# Workshop: Application of Google Earth Engine for Hydrologically-Based Machine Learning Applications
This tutorial creates a simple machine learning model to predict streamflow using Google Earth Engine (GEE) accesssed National Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) temperature and precipitation data.


## Objectives
Participants will learn how to:
*  **Virtual Environment.** Create a virtual Python environment for accessing data on the GEE platform.
*  **Remote Data Access.** Use a Jupyter environment to retrieve remote sensing data stored on the GEE platform, catchment information using StreamStats, and USGS streamguage information through the National Water Information System (NWIS). 
*  **Data Processing.** QA/QC real data, resample data to an apropriate temporal resolution, connect data to catchment attributes
*  **Machine Learning.** Build and train a machine learning model using GEE provided remote sensing data to predict streamflow.
* **Model Evaluation.** Explore and understand different methods and metrics for evaluating the performance of a ML hydrological model.
